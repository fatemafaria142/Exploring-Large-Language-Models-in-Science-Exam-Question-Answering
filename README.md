# Science Exam Question Answering System 

This project focuses on Science Exam Question Answering, utilizing two distinct datasets and a large language model. The datasets used are:

1. **Dataset Name:** sciq
   - **Dataset Link:** [sciq Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sciq)
   - **Description:** The "sciq" dataset is employed for Science Exam Question Answering. It provides valuable data for training and evaluating models in the field.

2. **Dataset Name:** ScienceQA_text_only
   - **Dataset Link:** [ScienceQA_text_only Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tasksource/ScienceQA_text_only)
   - **Description:** The "ScienceQA_text_only" dataset is another source of text data for Science Exam Question Answering. It complements the sciq dataset and enhances the variety of questions and answers.

3. **Large Language Models (LLMs) Used:**
